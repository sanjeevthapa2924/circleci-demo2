# CircleCI Tutorial

This repo corresponds to the tutorial I made for [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/). 

This tutorial is been modified by SANJEEV THAPA from (http://www.srcmake.com/home/circleci).

There are two Python files, one contains a function, and one contains a test.

More importantly, there's a `config.yml` file in the `.circleci` folder that will specify the jobs to be run on CircleCI any time the codebase changes.
